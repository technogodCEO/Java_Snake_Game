# Java_Snake_Game

A simple game inspired by snake made in java with swing.

## NOTE ON COORDINATE SYSTEM

The coordinate system of this app will be in 20x20 chunks starting at y = 140 and x = 20. This is because each square of the snake or the apple is 20x20 pixels. The padding on each side is for borders, the title, or any other text and or not directly game related functions
